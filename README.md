# ApexWebSnippets
<p>
  A personal collection of HTML, CSS and Javascript (mostly jQuery) code for Oracle Apex Development.
</p>
<p>
  This collection is built up as I research and develop for clients and serves mainly as a memory dump for myself. As are the follwing links:</br>
  <li> Substitution strings: https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/HTMDB/concept_sub.htm#HTMDB03022 </li>
  <li> Apex JS docs: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/application-express/18.2/aexjs/index.html </li>
